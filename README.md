As the result of this work, paper "On the Hard-Decision Multi-Threshold Decoding of Binary and Non-Binary LDPC Codes" is successfully represented at "XVI International Symposium Problems of Redundancy in Information and Control Systems", 2019.

## Milestones

1. [NB hard LDPC MatLab](https://github.com/dzisandy/qLDPC/tree/master/NB%20hard%20LDPC%20MatLab)
Implemented both algorithms from paper, built up a FER/p dependency. (As ISP research project)

2. [NB hard LDPC C++](https://github.com/dzisandy/qLDPC/tree/master/NB%20hard%20LDPC%20C%2B%2B)
Implemented single/multiple threshold majority decoding algorithms from paper, based on C++, MatLab, MeX for AWGN channel , BPSK modulation. Compared with simple majority (without threshold).

3. After simple simulation results and it's obsevrance, produced paper:
  "On the Hard-Decision Multi-Threshold Decoding of Binary and Non-Binary LDPC Codes"
  
## Results
1. Effect of multi-threshold decoding on binary performance in comparison with single-threshold for different column weights of matrices:
