# ON THE MULTIPLE THRESHOLD DECODING OF LDPC CODES OVER GF(q) (qLDPC)


## About
My implementations of single/multiple threshold majority decoding algorithms. The original paper by A.Frolov and V.Zyablov in "Advances in Mathematics of Communications", 2017.


## Milestones

1. Implemented both algorithms from paper, built up a FER/p dependency. (As ISP research project)

2. To be continued
