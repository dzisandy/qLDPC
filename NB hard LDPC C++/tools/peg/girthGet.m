function [girth, cyclesTable] = girthGet(H)
%Calculates global girth and local girths for the given parity-check
%matrix H
%   Usage: [girth, cyclesTable] = girthGet(H),
%   where H is a parity-check matrix of LDPC code, girth is a global girth
%   of bipartite graph corresponding to parity-check matrix H and
%   cyclesTable is a local girths for each variable node.
%  NOTICE: only full matrices are supported at this moment (for the sparse
%  matrix this function will crach).
