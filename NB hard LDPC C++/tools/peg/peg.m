function H = peg(M, N, LDeg, L)
%Construct parity-check matrix H with PEG method for the given sizes M and
%N and given degree distribution
%   Usage: H = peg(M, N, LDeg, L)
%   where M is a height of parity-check matrix H, N is a length of
%   parity-check matrix H, LDeg is a variable-nodes degree list, L is a
%   fraction of variable nodes with given degree (LDeg and L must be the
%   same length) and H is a return parity-check matrix H of LDPC code
%   (NOTICE: only full matrices are return at this moment).
