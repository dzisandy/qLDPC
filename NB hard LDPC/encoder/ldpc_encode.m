function [out] = ldpc_encode(in,G,q)
% function [out] = ldpc_encode(in,H,q)
% encodes data from "in" using G over GFq
% q = 2,4,8,16,32,64,128 or 256
% Please, make sure that the data you use is valid!
% Requires matlab communication toolbox for GFq operations.
% Basically, this function performs 'in*G' over GFq. 
% this function is slow, will write a C version some time
